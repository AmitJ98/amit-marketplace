"""Package responsible for restructuring integration files and directories.

This package provides modules that handle the reorganization of an integration's
components during the build process. This includes managing code, scripts,
dependencies, and metadata to ensure the integration is correctly structured
for deployment. It also includes functionality for deconstructing a built
integration back into its source file structure.
